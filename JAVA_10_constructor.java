                    CONSTRUCTOR
     #  Each time an object is created using a new() keyword, at least one constructor (it could be the
            default constructor) is invoked to assign initial values to the data members of the same class.
     #  Rules for writing constructors are as follows:
     #  The constructor(s) of a class must have the same name as the class name in which it resides.
     #  A constructor in Java can not be abstract, final, static, or Synchronized.
     #  Access modifiers can be used in constructor declaration to control its access i.e which other class can call the constructor.
     #  Constructor calling must be the first statement of constructor in Java.
     #  If we have defined any parameterized constructor, then compiler will not create default constructor. and vice versa if we donâ€™t define any constructor, the compiler creates the default constructor(also known as no-arg constructor) by default during compilation
     #  Recursive constructor calling is invalid in java.

     #  There are various scenarios where we can use private constructors. The major ones are
            Internal Constructor chaining
            Singleton class design pattern
